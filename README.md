# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze and predict customer churn in a telecom dataset. By understanding churn patterns, businesses can proactively engage at-risk customers and improve retention.

## 📂 Dataset Source

- **Title:** Customer Churn Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle – Muhammad Shahid Azeem](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadshahidazeem/customer-churn-dataset)
